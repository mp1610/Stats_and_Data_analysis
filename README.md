# Stats_and_Data_analysis

This project aims to make use of several important statistical models (such as regression models) to analyse datasets.
The project is carried out on RStudio using many different libraries, particularly Tidyverse and ggplot2. The rmd file can be viewed in its respective file directory.

To view the completed project, the knitted rmd file is saved as a pdf file which is also available in this repository. It showcases the application of data handling and statistical methods to analyse large datasets.

The project highlights the use of several data handling techniques to simplify, clean, and optimise the datasets prior to data analysis.
The statistical methods used in this project include: Linear regression, ANOVA, R-Squared, Logistic regression, Confidence intervals, Cross-validation, ROC curves, Confusion matrices, Multinomial regression, and Poisson/Quasi-Poisson regression.
